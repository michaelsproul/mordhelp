Mordhelp
========

Mordheim helper application available at https://mordheim.app

The primary purpose of this app is to save time looking up numbers in 2D grids! The app
renders _match-ups_ between your units and your opponent's units, showing rolls required to-hit and
to-wound for each pair.

Warbands are defined in JSON (no GUI builder, yet) in [./warbands](./warbands). Try uploading
these warbands on https://mordheim.app to get a feel for how it works.

## Planned Features

- [ ] Warband builder/editor.
- [ ] Warband online storage (share warbands between a group/campaign).
- [ ] Pinned match-ups for easy reference during a fight.
- [ ] Display special rules for weapons.
